This is the Quick Start Guide to ECTester. The document is a collection of field notes to help test Elliptic Curve cryptography implementations and support.

The docbook manual is ectester.pdf. If you find errors or omissions then make pull requests and open bug reports.

The book is built using DocBook. The instructions to setup DocBook on Ubuntu 16.04 with Apache FOP 2.2 are in setup/docbook.pdf. Once DocBook is setup just run `make-book.sh` to create the book.
