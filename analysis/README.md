# Analysis

This directory contains several analysis scripts and Jupyter notebooks that supplement and analyze the
results provided by the main ECTester tools (reader or standalone).

The [`countermeasures`](countermeasures/) subdirectory contains an artifact of the CHES 2025 paper
"*ECTester: Reverse-engineering side-channel countermeasures of ECC implementations*".
